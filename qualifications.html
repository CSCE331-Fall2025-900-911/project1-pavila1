                <h1>My Qualifications & Resume</h1>
                <p>I believe that a strong foundation in computer science is built on more than just a list of programming languages; it's about a passion for problem-solving, a commitment to lifelong learning, and the ability to work collaboratively to build innovative solutions. My academic journey has provided me with a robust theoretical understanding of software engineering principles, from algorithm design to data structures, and my hands-on projects have allowed me to apply this knowledge in practical, real-world contexts.</p>
                <p>My technical skills are a blend of academic learning and personal exploration. I've gained proficiency in core languages such as Python, Java, and C++, each offering a unique lens for tackling different computational challenges. In web development, I have experience with HTML and CSS, which I used to build the very website you are currently viewing, demonstrating my understanding of modern web design and user experience. I am also familiar with front-end frameworks like React and back-end technologies like Node.js, and I am committed to expanding my knowledge in these areas. On the database side, I have worked with both SQL and non-relational databases like MongoDB, understanding the importance of data management in application development. The tools of the trade are equally important, and I have a solid grasp of version control with Git, containerization with Docker, and integrated development environments like VS Code.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technical, I have a strong interest in the ethical implications of artificial intelligence and the role of technology in society. I am particularly fascinated by the field of generative AI and its potential to revolutionize creative industries. This interest has driven me to explore projects that leverage AI to generate unique content and solve complex problems in novel ways. I am a firm believer that the best solutions are not just technically sound but are also thoughtfully designed to serve a greater purpose. As I continue my education, I am eager to delve deeper into these areas, pursuing opportunities that challenge me to grow as both a developer and a responsible digital citizen. My resume provides a more detailed look at my academic and professional journey, and I invite you to explore the rest of my portfolio to see my skills in action.</p>
