                            <p>
                                My journey into engineering wasn't a straight line, but at the end of the day, I found my calling with **computers**, and I really do enjoy it. It all came about from a curiosity about **how the world works**, and I really want to learn more about how technological advancements interlace with us, more like in a theoretical way of computers, as I've always been fascinated by them. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For me, engineering is the perfect way to **express myself** and to really **challenge myself** with complex problems and the developing world as we speak. This major provides the ideal mix of logic and creativity that keeps me passionate and engaged every day.
